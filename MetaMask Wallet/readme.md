# MetaMask-Wallet
An Ethereum Wallet in your Browser
MetaMask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your browser!

The extension injects the Ethereum web3 API into every website's javascript context, so that dapps can read from the blockchain.

MetaMask also lets the user create and manage their own identities (via private keys, local client wallet and hardware wallets like Trezorâ„¢), so when a Dapp wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.

We have created a flask application that connects your MetaMask Wallet account for easier access
